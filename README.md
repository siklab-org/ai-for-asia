## Design System

The site uses a custom dark theme with a 5-color brand gradient:

```
#0060BA → #336FCF → #8561C5 → #C671AF → #E39297
```

Custom utility classes include `.text-gradient`, `.glass`, `.grid-bg`, `.bg-gradient-radial`, and several keyframe animations (`float`, `shimmer`, `pulse-glow`, `gradient-shift`).
